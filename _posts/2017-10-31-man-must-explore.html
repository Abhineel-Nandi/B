<p>The difference between a breeded coder and a begginer is this main fact : <em>TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS </em>.Today we will be tackling this issue in the most easiest way there ever was or been.
</p>

<p>First of all lets see at what do we basically mean by the term <b>Time Complexity</b>.Basically it means an analytical approach taken, to make a strong assumption ,based on the input constraints provided. And then choose the Simplest Algo that would fit into it <em>snugly</em>.</p>

<p>Time Complexity is measured in terms of order and magnitude.By order we mean the rate of Growth of your algorithm vs time.</p>

<p>Given below is the best cheatsheet which must be of outmost importance to all coders.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">A Graph Explaining  The Order of magnitudes of Some Common Algorithms.</span>

<p>As shown in the above figure .We notice that its been divided into three color zones [Red,Yellow and Green].The red zone is the in programming jargon known as the Brute-Force or Naive Algorithm Zone.</p>

<p>In easy words some of the most lengthy code implementations like the recursive fibbonaci series and some of the brute-force permutation problems.</p>

<p>Again in this image we can see that those data structures which have efficient order of growth are represented in Green and slightly exhausting ones given in yellow.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have now had a breif and small introduction to time complexities of the so called "FOUNDATIONAL ALGO'S TO COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING". This difiiculty wise and efficiency wise sorted Graphs are your companion whom you should keep to your side always in a competitive contest to help gain a faster idea regarding what or what not to implement.Or if i will implement this and, go forward with this approach then how much will it cost me in terms of time and space.</p>

With this I am signing off today my freinds will see you with another topic SOON !!!
