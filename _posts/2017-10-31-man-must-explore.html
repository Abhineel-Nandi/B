<p>The difference between a breeded coder and a begginer is this main fact : <em>TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS </em>.Today we will be tackling this issue in the most easiest way there ever was or been.
</p>

<p>First of all lets see at what do we basically mean by the term <b>Time Complexity</b>.Basically it means an analytical approach taken, to make a strong assumption ,based on the input constraints provided. And then choose the Simplest Algo that would fit into it <em>snugly</em>.</p>

<p>Time Complexity is measured in terms of order and magnitude.By order we mean the rate of Growth of your algorithm vs time.</p>

<p>Given below is the best cheatsheet which must be of outmost importance to all coders.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
